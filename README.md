# auto-translate-for-fedora

i've made this for my own requirements. 

usage is so simple. download this repo and enter -->

settings/keyboard/view and customize shortcuts/custom shortcuts

in there you can create any shortcut you want. and type this command to shortcut -->

gnome-terminal -e "/path/to/file/auto-translate-for-fedora/google-translate.sh"

and it's done. now you can translate any text with one shorcut.
