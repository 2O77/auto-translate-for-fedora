# auto-translate-for-fedora

i've made this for my own requirements. 

# usage is so simple. download this repo and enter -->

fedora settings/keyboard/view and customize shortcuts/custom shortcuts

# in there create a shortcut and type this command. -->

gnome-terminal -e "/path/to/file/auto-translate-for-fedora/google-translate.sh"

and it's done. now you can translate any text with one shorcut. 

# you have to give permission to file -->

cd /path/to/file

chmod +x google-translate.sh
